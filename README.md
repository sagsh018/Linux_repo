# RedHat Enterprice Linux (RHEL)

## Lab setup
    We are going to start with RHCSA, which include basic Linux stuff. For this we would need one virtual machine in order
    to practive the commands and concepts

    Then we will move towards the advance linux RHCE, which include client server model like NFS, SMB, Apache, etc.
    Here we would need two virtual machines one acting as client machine and another one acting as a server.
